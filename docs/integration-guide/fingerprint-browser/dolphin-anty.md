# Dolphin Anty Fingerprint Browser — 006IP Proxy Guide

***Before using 006IP proxy services, make sure your local network can reliably access international websites and services. If you encounter connection issues, check your local network connection or contact customer support for assistance.***


006IP is a residential proxy infrastructure provider serving enterprises, developers, and teams operating across international markets. Its offerings include **dynamic residential IPs  and static residential IPs**. The platform supports country/region- and city-level geo-targeting, with dashboard controls for IP allowlisting, proxy authentication methods, and location targeting options. It is suitable for compliant web data collection, localized website testing, price monitoring, ad verification, and maintaining stable network environments for cross-border operations.

Among these offerings, **static residential IPs** provide a long-term, fixed egress IP address, making them better suited for use cases that require IP consistency and stable connectivity. In this guide, we will use a 006IP static residential proxy as an example and walk through account registration, claiming free trial proxy traffic, purchasing a proxy, exporting proxy credentials, and configuring and testing the 006IP proxy in the **Dolphin Anty fingerprint browser**.

## Basic Setup

### 1. Register and Sign In to 006IP

First, open the [006IP website](https://006ip.com/) and click **Sign up** in the upper-right corner. If you already have an account, click **Sign in** instead.

![006ip website sign-up entry](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/config-tutorial/006ip-homepage-en.png)

Next, choose either of the following registration methods:

#### Option 1: Register by Email

Select **Email Register**, then enter your account/email, email verification code, password, and confirmation password. Click **Send Code**, check your email for the verification code, enter it, agree to the **Terms** and **Privacy Policy**, and then click **Sign Up**.

![006ip email registration](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/config-tutorial/006ip-register-email-en.png)

#### Option 2: Register by Mobile Number

Select **Mobile Register**, confirm the correct country or region calling code, enter your phone number, click **Send Code**, and enter the SMS verification code. Agree to the **Terms** and **Privacy Policy**, then click **Sign Up**.

After registering with a mobile number, you will be signed in automatically. The account initially uses the default password state, so go to your account settings and set your own login password as soon as possible.

![006ip mobile registration](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/config-tutorial/006ip-register-phone-en.png)

> The homepage also provides a **Sign Up with Gmail** shortcut. If you use Gmail, follow the on-screen authorization prompts to complete registration.

### 2. Claim Free Trial Proxy Traffic

006IP currently offers a trial promotion for new users: contact customer support to receive **1 GB of free proxy traffic**. Eligibility requirements, supported products, and the validity period are subject to the current promotion page and confirmation from customer support.

> You can use the trial traffic to verify the target location, proxy protocol compatibility, and connectivity for your use case before purchasing a paid plan.

### 3. Purchase a Static Residential Proxy

After signing in to the 006IP dashboard, click **Static Proxies** in the left-hand navigation menu, then select **ISP Proxies** or **Datacenter Proxies** as needed to open the purchase page.

#### Step 1: Choose a Purchase Mode and Configure Proxy Settings

The purchase page provides two configuration options: **Quick Configuration** and **Custom Configuration**. Both calculate pricing in real time based on the selected resources and configuration, but they are designed for different requirements.

##### (1) Quick Configuration

Quick Configuration is suitable for users who want to use the platform's default network configuration and place an order quickly. In this mode, you mainly configure the following options:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Access Type** | Choose **Dedicated** or **Shared**. Dedicated IPs are better suited for use cases with stricter requirements for IP reputation, stability, and isolation from other users. Shared IPs are better suited for standard access scenarios where cost is the priority. |
| **Country/Region and City** | Target a specific country/region and city, or select a random location for country-level IP allocation. |
| **Subscription Period** | The official guide lists subscription periods ranging from 30 to 365 days. Medium- and long-term plans may automatically qualify for tiered discounts. Final pricing is subject to the purchase page. |
| **Default Settings** | **Connections (QPS)**, port bandwidth, and UDP use the default values displayed on the page. |

![006ip static proxy Quick Configuration](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/en/purchase-quick-mode.png)

##### (2) Custom Configuration

If you need to specify an IP range or adjust **Connections (QPS)**, port bandwidth, or UDP, enable **Custom Configuration**. This mode also allows you to select a use case, allocate the purchase quantity based on city and subnet inventory, and choose the subscription period. Different configurations affect the final price, so review the **Order Summary** on the right before submitting the order.

![006ip static proxy Custom Configuration](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/en/purchase-custom-mode.png)

#### Step 2: Confirm the Order and Complete Payment

After entering the order confirmation page, the system reserves the selected IP inventory for **15 minutes**. If payment is not completed within that time, the reserved IP resources will be released automatically and you will need to place the order again.

The payment methods listed in the official 006IP guide include:

- **Account balance**;
- **Online payment**;
- **A combination of account balance and online payment**.

If your account balance is insufficient, you can apply the available balance first and pay the remaining amount through one of the online payment methods shown on the page. When using your account balance, you need to enter the payment password configured on the 006IP platform. Available online payment channels and supported currencies are subject to what is displayed on the checkout page.

![006ip order confirmation and payment](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/en/order-payment.png)

### 4. View and Export Proxy Connection Details

After payment is completed, open **My IPs** from the left-hand menu to view your purchased static IPs. The list displays bandwidth, QPS, UDP status, expiration date, and resource status, and also provides options to renew, disable, enable, and view details.

![006ip My IPs list](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/en/my-ip-list.png)

Before configuring Dolphin Anty, prepare the following four proxy connection details:

- **Proxy IP address**
- **Port**
- **Username**
- **Password**

On the **My IPs** page, click **Export Credentials** in the upper-right corner and select the proxy credential format required by your client. You can use the standard format:

```text
HOST:PORT:USERNAME:PASSWORD
```

The exported file contains plaintext proxy credentials. Store it securely and do not share the credentials through public chats, screenshots, or untrusted channels.

![006ip export proxy credentials](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/en/export-credentials.png)

For the latest purchase and credential export procedures, refer to the [006IP Static Proxy User Guide](/static-proxy-user-guide/) and the current instructions shown in the dashboard.

## Configure Dolphin Anty

After completing the steps above and obtaining the **proxy host, proxy port, proxy username, and proxy password** from 006IP, follow the steps below to configure the proxy in **Dolphin Anty**.

### 1. Create a New Browser Profile

Open the Dolphin Anty client. On the **All profiles** page, click the **+** button at the top to create a new browser profile.

![Create a new browser profile](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/config-tutorial/dolphinanty-1.png)

### 2. Enter the 006IP Proxy Information

On the **New profile** page, find the **Proxy** section under **General**, then select **New proxy**.

Configure the proxy using the information provided by 006IP:

- **Proxy protocol**: Select the protocol that matches the proxy provided by 006IP, such as `HTTP`, `SOCKS4`, or `SOCKS5`. The example in the screenshot uses `HTTP`.

- **Proxy**: Enter the proxy server information provided by 006IP, including the proxy host, port, username, and password.

- **Change IP URL**: If the current 006IP proxy provides an IP rotation or refresh URL, enter it here. If not, leave this field blank.

- **Proxy name**: Optionally enter a proxy name for easier identification and management, or leave it blank.

The proxy protocol must match the protocol actually provided by 006IP. If the wrong protocol is selected, the proxy may fail to connect even if the host, port, username, and password are entered correctly.

![Enter the 006IP proxy](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/config-tutorial/dolphinanty-2.png)

After the proxy information is entered, Dolphin Anty will check the proxy automatically.

If the proxy is available, the status will appear below the proxy field together with the corresponding IP geolocation information, such as the country/region, state/province, city, and time zone. This indicates that the 006IP proxy can connect successfully.

If the proxy check fails, check the following items in order:

- Make sure the proxy host and port are entered correctly.

- Make sure the proxy username and password are correct.

- Confirm that the proxy protocol selected in Dolphin Anty matches the protocol provided by 006IP.

- Make sure the current proxy is still active.

- Check whether your local network can reach the proxy server.

### 3. Create and Launch the Browser Profile

After confirming that the proxy is working, continue configuring the browser fingerprint, platform, User-Agent, and other settings as needed.

Once everything is confirmed, click **CREATE PROFILE** in the lower-right corner to create the browser profile.

![Create and launch the browser profile](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/config-tutorial/dolphinanty-3.png)

Return to the **All profiles** page, find the profile you just created, and click **START**. Once launched, network requests from that browser profile will be routed through the configured 006IP proxy when accessing target websites.

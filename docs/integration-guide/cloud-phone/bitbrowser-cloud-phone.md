# BitBrowser Cloud Phone — 006IP Proxy Guide

***Before using 006IP proxy services, make sure your local network can reliably access international websites and services. If you encounter connection issues, check your local network connection or contact customer support for assistance.***


006IP is a residential proxy infrastructure provider serving enterprises, developers, and teams operating across international markets. Its offerings include **dynamic residential IPs  and static residential IPs**. The platform supports country/region- and city-level geo-targeting, with dashboard controls for IP allowlisting, proxy authentication methods, and location targeting options. It is suitable for compliant web data collection, localized website testing, price monitoring, ad verification, and maintaining stable network environments for cross-border operations.

Among these offerings, **static residential IPs** provide a long-term, fixed egress IP address, making them better suited for use cases that require IP consistency and stable connectivity. In this guide, we will use a 006IP static residential proxy as an example and walk through account registration, claiming free trial proxy traffic, purchasing a proxy, exporting proxy credentials, and configuring and testing the 006IP proxy in the **BitBrowser Cloud Phone**.

## Basic Setup

### 1. Register and Sign In to 006IP

First, open the [006IP website](https://006ip.com/) and click **Sign up** in the upper-right corner. If you already have an account, click **Sign in** instead.

![006ip website sign-up entry](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/config-tutorial/006ip-homepage-en.png)

Next, choose either of the following registration methods:

#### Option 1: Register by Email

Select **Email Register**, then enter your account/email, email verification code, password, and confirmation password. Click **Send Code**, check your email for the verification code, enter it, agree to the **Terms** and **Privacy Policy**, and then click **Sign Up**.

![006ip email registration](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/config-tutorial/006ip-register-email-en.png)

#### Option 2: Register by Mobile Number

Select **Mobile Register**, confirm the correct country or region calling code, enter your phone number, click **Send Code**, and enter the SMS verification code. Agree to the **Terms** and **Privacy Policy**, then click **Sign Up**.

After registering with a mobile number, you will be signed in automatically. The account initially uses the default password state, so go to your account settings and set your own login password as soon as possible.

![006ip mobile registration](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/config-tutorial/006ip-register-phone-en.png)

> The homepage also provides a **Sign Up with Gmail** shortcut. If you use Gmail, follow the on-screen authorization prompts to complete registration.

### 2. Claim Free Trial Proxy Traffic

006IP currently offers a trial promotion for new users: contact customer support to receive **1 GB of free proxy traffic**. Eligibility requirements, supported products, and the validity period are subject to the current promotion page and confirmation from customer support.

> You can use the trial traffic to verify the target location, proxy protocol compatibility, and connectivity for your use case before purchasing a paid plan.

### 3. Purchase a Static Residential Proxy

After signing in to the 006IP dashboard, click **Static Proxies** in the left-hand navigation menu, then select **ISP Proxies** or **Datacenter Proxies** as needed to open the purchase page.

#### Step 1: Choose a Purchase Mode and Configure Proxy Settings

The purchase page provides two configuration options: **Quick Configuration** and **Custom Configuration**. Both calculate pricing in real time based on the selected resources and configuration, but they are designed for different requirements.

##### (1) Quick Configuration

Quick Configuration is suitable for users who want to use the platform's default network configuration and place an order quickly. In this mode, you mainly configure the following options:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Access Type** | Choose **Dedicated** or **Shared**. Dedicated IPs are better suited for use cases with stricter requirements for IP reputation, stability, and isolation from other users. Shared IPs are better suited for standard access scenarios where cost is the priority. |
| **Country/Region and City** | Target a specific country/region and city, or select a random location for country-level IP allocation. |
| **Subscription Period** | The official guide lists subscription periods ranging from 30 to 365 days. Medium- and long-term plans may automatically qualify for tiered discounts. Final pricing is subject to the purchase page. |
| **Default Settings** | **Connections (QPS)**, port bandwidth, and UDP use the default values displayed on the page. |

![006ip static proxy Quick Configuration](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/en/purchase-quick-mode.png)

##### (2) Custom Configuration

If you need to specify an IP range or adjust **Connections (QPS)**, port bandwidth, or UDP, enable **Custom Configuration**. This mode also allows you to select a use case, allocate the purchase quantity based on city and subnet inventory, and choose the subscription period. Different configurations affect the final price, so review the **Order Summary** on the right before submitting the order.

![006ip static proxy Custom Configuration](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/en/purchase-custom-mode.png)

#### Step 2: Confirm the Order and Complete Payment

After entering the order confirmation page, the system reserves the selected IP inventory for **15 minutes**. If payment is not completed within that time, the reserved IP resources will be released automatically and you will need to place the order again.

The payment methods listed in the official 006IP guide include:

- **Account balance**;
- **Online payment**;
- **A combination of account balance and online payment**.

If your account balance is insufficient, you can apply the available balance first and pay the remaining amount through one of the online payment methods shown on the page. When using your account balance, you need to enter the payment password configured on the 006IP platform. Available online payment channels and supported currencies are subject to what is displayed on the checkout page.

![006ip order confirmation and payment](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/en/order-payment.png)

### 4. View and Export Proxy Connection Details

After payment is completed, open **My IPs** from the left-hand menu to view your purchased static IPs. The list displays bandwidth, QPS, UDP status, expiration date, and resource status, and also provides options to renew, disable, enable, and view details.

![006ip My IPs list](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/en/my-ip-list.png)

Before configuring BitBrowser Cloud Phone, prepare the following four proxy connection details:

- **Proxy IP address**
- **Port**
- **Username**
- **Password**

On the **My IPs** page, click **Export Credentials** in the upper-right corner and select the proxy credential format required by your client. You can use the standard format:

```text
HOST:PORT:USERNAME:PASSWORD
```

The exported file contains plaintext proxy credentials. Store it securely and do not share the credentials through public chats, screenshots, or untrusted channels.

![006ip export proxy credentials](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/en/export-credentials.png)

For the latest purchase and credential export procedures, refer to the [006IP Static Proxy User Guide](/static-proxy-user-guide/) and the current instructions shown in the dashboard.

## Configure BitBrowser Cloud Phone

After completing the steps above and obtaining the **proxy IP address, port, username, and password** from 006IP, you can configure the proxy in a BitBrowser Cloud Phone environment.

If the proxy credentials exported from 006IP use the following format:

```text
HOST:PORT:USERNAME:PASSWORD
```

you can either enter `HOST`, `PORT`, `USERNAME`, and `PASSWORD` into the corresponding proxy host, port, username, and password fields in BitBrowser Cloud Phone, or paste the full proxy string directly if your client supports automatic parsing. The steps below follow the current BitBrowser Cloud Phone interface to complete proxy setup and connectivity testing.

### 1. Create a Cloud Phone Environment

Open **BitBrowser**, go to **Phone Profiles** from the left-hand menu, and click **Add** at the top of the page.

![Create a cloud phone environment in BitBrowser](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/config-tutorial/create-bitcloudphone-environment-en.png)

On the **Add** page, choose the proxy type in the proxy configuration section. In this example, select:

- **Type**: `Socks5`
- **Protocol**: `IPv4`

> BitBrowser Cloud Phone environments are intended to run with a configured proxy. Before proceeding, make sure your current network can connect properly to the proxy node you plan to use.

### 2. Enter the 006IP Proxy Details

In 006IP, collect the proxy details you want to use, including:

- Proxy host
- Proxy port
- Proxy username
- Proxy password

BitBrowser supports pasting the full proxy string directly into the **Host** field and automatically splitting it into the proxy host, port, username, and password fields. The interface supports the following format:

```text
HOST:PORT:USERNAME:PASSWORD
```

After pasting the 006IP proxy details, confirm that the **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, and **Password** fields have been filled correctly.

![Paste the 006IP proxy details and auto-fill the fields](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/config-tutorial/bitcloudphone-paste-proxy-shortcut-auto-fill-en.png)

If you do not use automatic parsing, you can also enter the proxy details manually in the corresponding fields.

### 3. Check the Proxy Connection

After entering the proxy information, click **Check Proxy** in the upper-right corner.

![Check the 006IP proxy connection in BitBrowser Cloud Phone](https://cdn.006ip.com/docs/img/static-proxy/config-tutorial/bitcloudphone-proxy-connection-test-en.png)

If the connection test is successful, the page will display the current proxy IP and the corresponding country/region, state/province, city, latitude and longitude, and time zone. Confirm that the detected information matches the 006IP proxy node you are using.

The **Language**, **Timezone**, and **Geolocation** settings below can automatically generate the corresponding environment information based on the current proxy IP by default. Once everything is confirmed, click **Confirm** in the lower-right corner to finish creating the Cloud Phone environment.
